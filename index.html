        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year college student at the University of California, Riverside where I am on a Pre-Business path. I have always been interested in the field of business and technology and aspire to have a career in a field that blends the two once Iâ€™m done with school. Growing up, I never realized I had an interest in the business and technology sectors. I always thought that in order to get respect from your friends, family, and society in general, you needed to be a doctor or a lawyer. It was black and white for me. Either you go after and chase one of those two professions, or you will not have a respected career.<br><br>

        Part of that type of thinking originated in the community and society I grew up in. However, this was before the recent boom in technology and the never-ending availability of new Silicon Valley jobs that became socially acceptable. With more and more people landing jobs at modern technology companies, this trend became socially acceptable. As technology companies expanded, innovated, and became a leading force in the job market sector, they positioned themselves as an established workforce, one that was not going anywhere any time soon. I say all this to say that this how I became fascinated with technology companies and eventually primarily focusing on the business aspect of them as well. One of the companies Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by is Apple. Particularly, the organization and methods of how they bring their products to life.<br><br>

        Apple, as a company, has influenced my life in many ways. I really started to look into them right before my freshman year of college when I was fortunate enough to receive my first iPhone. From being amazed at the design of the device to spending countless hours closely taking a look at its user interface, I was obsessed with the device and all the aspects of it. This fascination quickly grew from the iPhone itself to not only other products from Apple but eventually to Apple, as an organization itself. As the years went by, I would spend time researching the history of Apple, how they came to be, and what they were going to do or produce in the future. From watching developer conferences and reading rumor sites about upcoming product launches to literally being excited the morning of their world-renowned keynotes, I was fully invested and could see this as the only viable option moving forward for a future career path. I credit Apple for allowing me to discover a passion that I never knew I had for the vast world of technology. Reading more about them and learning how they conduct business on a day-to-day basis helped me to cement my interest from a hobby to an attainable reality. Without this direction, I would have been lost as to what I wanted to do with my life for the future. This corporation really has shaped me in more avenues than I could ever imagine for myself as a result. This is just really me.
